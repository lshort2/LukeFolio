    <div class="bg-dark large-10 cell text-left p-1rem">
      <p>I wanted to challenge myself and avoid using any of the tools I am normally accustomed to (bootstrap, django, AWS, etc).</p>
      <p>I feel like sometimes it is good to have extra options in the toolbelt and just fun to have an idea of what other popular frameworks and tools are like.</p>

    <div class="bg-dark large-10 cell text-left p-1rem">
      <p>This site is intended to show different involvements in my life. I use the vague word "involvements" intentionally. Almost all the projects I have worked on are viewable from GitHub, so I am not so sure there would be much added value to listing them all out again here. This site is more so a way to share mention of some overarching things in my life that probably spanned months or even years.</p>
      <p>It is not, however intended to be a full-fledged life story or documentary. More so, a way to show others some things that I have been involved in and if they are interested, they can ask me questions.</p>
