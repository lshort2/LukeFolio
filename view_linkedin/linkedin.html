  <p>This is the partial for LinkedIn view, okay?</p>
  <p>Although I did obtain the twitter handle @I_like_tamales once upon a time in my undergrad years, I do not have much of a social media prescence these days. Nonetheless, I do check in to LinkedIn and would be 10x more excited if you send me a message asking a question about tech or proposing a programming challenge.</p>

  <p class="txt-light bg-dark">A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control,[1] is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.</p>

  <p>I spend a bit of time doing coding challenges over on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/LukeyLuke">CodeWars</a>.</p>
  <p>Some of the things I have been working on, like server configs or deployment setups are not checked into source control. However, I try to be pretty transparent in what I do and make as many repositories as possible publicly viewable.</p>
