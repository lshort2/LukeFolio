      <p>My main hobbies include motorcycles, mountain bikes, camping, and Star Wars.</p>
      <p>When I have enough down time, you can typically expect me to disappear into the woods for a few days. I love being able to camp out in the wildness and explore new trails on my mountain bike.</p>

      <p>One of the major driving questions in my life has been:</p>
      <h3 class="text-center"><em>"How do computers work?"</em></h3>

      <p>After my undergraduate education, I am not so convinced that any one person can really answer this question, because of the vast amalgamation of knowledge put together to push that technology to where it is today. However, that does not mean it's not a good goal to have.</p>
      <p>I am particularly curious to find out more about machine learning and find out more ways that machine learning models can be leveraged to further improve computer architecture and the overall efficiency of machines in the world we live in.</p>
      <p>Overall, I just really enjoy programming right now and I want to learn more about what else is out there.</p>
