      <p>Being invited to Tau Beta Pi was a genuine surprise for me. After receiving the invitation, attending four meetings, and interviewing, I was initiated to the California Alpha Alpha chapter the Fall of 2015.</p>
      <p>Tau Beta Pi taught me the value of integrity and acting like a professional. Prior to initiation, I had never worn a suit before in my entire life. Likewise, the CAAA chapter whipped me into shape for interviews.</p>

      <p>I recall running for President of Tau Beta Pi my senior year and losing by a handful of votes.</p>
      <p>I was only really upset about this for maybe five seconds. I knew that my friend, Eric Lovell, had been a Tau Bate longer than me and would make a great president. And he did. I got the opportunity to be Vice President, so in the end I still got to be very involved with our chapter.</p>
      <p>My responsibility for the chapter was to interview new candidates as well as oversee the planning and organization of our initiation ceremony. Ordering all the necessary paperwork seemed stressful at first, because the shipping times seemed unclear. Luckily, we have a great group at TBP HQ over in Knoxville Tenessee and they were able to get us squared away. I set time aside with the other officers to do a dry run and practice speaking our parts a week ahead of time, so when it came to the actual ceremony, the event went smoothly.</p>
